## üö® SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE - CREDENTIAL COMPROMISE

**Date:** 2025-01-04  
**Status:** CRITICAL - ACTIVE REMEDIATION  
**Affected Systems:** All production services  

### Compromised Credentials Identified

1. **Supabase Production Database** (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
   - **URL:** `[REDACTED - COMPROMISED URL REMOVED]`
   - **Anon Key:** `[REDACTED - COMPROMISED KEY REMOVED]`
   - **Status:** COMPROMISED - ROTATE IMMEDIATELY
   - **Risk Level:** CRITICAL - Full database access

2. **MinIO Storage Credentials** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - **Access Key:** `[DEFAULT_REMOVED]` (default)
   - **Secret Key:** `[DEFAULT_REMOVED]` (default) 
   - **Status:** WEAK/DEFAULT - ROTATED
   - **Risk Level:** HIGH - File storage access

3. **JWT Secrets** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - **JWT Secret:** Previously weak
   - **Refresh Secret:** Previously weak
   - **Status:** ROTATED ‚úÖ
   - **Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Authentication bypass

## Immediate Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Generated new secure MinIO credentials (32+ char hex)
- [x] Generated new secure JWT secrets (64 char hex)
- [x] Updated .env file with secure credentials
- [x] Updated docker-compose.dev.yml with new MinIO credentials
- [x] Removed `.env.supabase.backup` file containing exposed secrets
- [x] Implemented comprehensive environment validation
- [x] Added startup security checks
- [x] Created credential rotation procedures

### üîÑ In Progress
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Rotate Supabase credentials in dashboard
- [ ] Update production environment variables
- [ ] Test all services with new credentials
- [ ] Deploy security validation to all environments

### ‚è≥ Pending
- [ ] Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Notify all team members of credential changes
- [ ] Schedule regular credential rotation (90-day cycle)
- [ ] Implement secret management service integration

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Environment Validation System
```typescript
// Location: src/utils/env-validator.ts
- Validates all environment variables on startup
- Detects compromised credentials
- Enforces minimum security standards
- Prevents application startup with weak credentials
```

### 2. Credential Rotation System
```typescript
// Location: src/scripts/rotate-credentials.ts
- Automated secure credential generation
- Step-by-step rotation instructions
- Backup and audit trail
- Security validation checklist
```

### 3. Startup Security Checks
```typescript
// Location: src/index.ts
- Comprehensive environment validation
- Immediate shutdown on security violations
- Detailed security logging
- Audit trail for compliance
```

## Credential Security Standards

### Minimum Requirements
- **JWT Secrets:** 64 characters (32-byte hex)
- **MinIO Keys:** 32+ characters, cryptographically random
- **Database Passwords:** 16+ characters, high complexity
- **API Keys:** Service-specific, regularly rotated

### Forbidden Values
- Default credentials (minioadmin, admin, password)
- Previously compromised keys
- Weak/predictable patterns
- Development placeholders in production

### Rotation Schedule
- **Critical Systems:** 30 days
- **Standard Systems:** 90 days
- **Development:** 180 days
- **Emergency:** Immediate upon compromise

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Environment validation passes
- [ ] All credentials meet security standards
- [ ] No compromised values detected
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Monitoring configured

### During Deployment
- [ ] Rolling restart of services
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] No service interruptions
- [ ] Credential validation successful

### After Deployment
- [ ] Full system functionality verified
- [ ] Security monitoring active
- [ ] Old credentials revoked
- [ ] Incident documentation updated
- [ ] Team notification completed

## Supabase Credential Rotation (URGENT)

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Login to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select the compromised project
3. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API

### Step 2: Generate New Credentials
1. **Generate new API keys:**
   - Click "Reset" on anon/public key
   - Click "Reset" on service_role key
   - Save new keys immediately

2. **Reset database password:**
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Database
   - Generate new secure password
   - Update connection strings

### Step 3: Update Applications
1. Update all `.env` files with new credentials
2. Update Kubernetes secrets
3. Update CI/CD pipelines
4. Update monitoring systems

### Step 4: Revoke Old Credentials
1. Confirm new credentials work
2. Revoke old API keys
3. Change database password
4. Monitor for failed access attempts

## Monitoring and Detection

### Security Alerts
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- Credential validation failures
- Environment security violations

### Logging Requirements
- All credential rotation activities
- Security validation results
- Failed authentication attempts
- Environment variable changes

### Audit Trail
- Who rotated credentials
- When rotation occurred
- Which systems were updated
- Verification of successful rotation

## Contact Information

### Security Team
- **Primary:** Security Engineer
- **Secondary:** DevOps Team
- **Escalation:** CTO/Technical Lead

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Immediate:** Stop all affected services
2. **Assess:** Determine scope of compromise
3. **Rotate:** Generate new secure credentials
4. **Deploy:** Update all systems
5. **Monitor:** Watch for unauthorized access
6. **Report:** Document incident details

## Compliance and Governance

### Documentation Requirements
- All credential changes must be documented
- Security reviews for new credentials
- Regular audit of credential usage
- Compliance with data protection laws

### Access Control
- Limit credential access to essential personnel
- Use principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Multi-factor authentication required

## Recovery Procedures

### Service Recovery
1. Verify new credentials are active
2. Test all authentication flows
3. Confirm database connectivity
4. Validate file storage access
5. Check all integrations

### Rollback Plan
1. Keep backup of working credentials (encrypted)
2. Document rollback procedures
3. Test rollback in staging environment
4. Have emergency contact list ready
