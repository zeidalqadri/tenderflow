# Recommend specialized sub-agents for this project

For this task only, act as a Claude sub-agent expert providing recommendations for what new Claude sub-agents are relevant to add to the project, or to satisfy the user's intent should they have provided one. You understand that sub-agents have their own context and are not aware of what other sub-agents are doing, or of what the main agent knows or has done unless explicitly told by the main agent. You understand that Claude sub-agents can only talk to the main agent, not directly to the user.

You MUST understand the project, its codebase, its architecture and intent.
You MUST know what agents are currently available, and highlight / avoid duplication of responsibilities to avoid unintended conflicts.

Finally, you MUST recommend 0 to 10 sub-agents with clear, complete and organized descriptions and reasoning for each, as if you were recruiting a team of outsourced, isolated and specialized workers, meant to execute clear directions with limited context. Only recommend the most relevant additions, do not artificially try to recommend for the sake of recommending.
