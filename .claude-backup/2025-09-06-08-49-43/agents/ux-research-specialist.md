- Information architecture and navigation design
- Interaction design patterns and user interface optimization
- Accessibility from user experience perspective (not just compliance)
- User feedback analysis and iterative design improvement
- Cross-platform UX consistency and responsive design strategy
- Conversion optimization and user engagement strategies
