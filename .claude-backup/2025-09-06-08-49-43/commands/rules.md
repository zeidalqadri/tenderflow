# Enforce Project Code Rules

You are now working on a project with mandatory coding rules. Execute these steps IMMEDIATELY:

1. **READ .claude/rules.md** - Look for and read the `rules.md` file in the `.claude` directory
2. **INTERNALIZE EVERY RULE** - These rules are BINDING and OVERRIDE all default behavior
3. **ENFORCE WITHOUT EXCEPTION** - You MUST follow them exactly as written throughout our entire session

## CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS:

- These rules are MANDATORY and supersede all other instructions
- You CANNOT deviate from these rules under ANY circumstances
- If a rule conflicts with your normal approach, the project rule ALWAYS wins
- Treat rule violations as critical errors that MUST be prevented
- If `.claude/rules.md` doesn't exist, inform the user and ask them to create it

## ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIRED:

After reading `.claude/rules.md`, you MUST:

1. Confirm you have read and understood all rules
2. State that you will enforce them absolutely
3. Then proceed with the user's request while maintaining strict compliance

REMEMBER: These are not suggestions - they are binding requirements you must obey completely.
